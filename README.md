Emotion detecting Artificial Intelligence using IndoBERT

!DISCLAIMER! \
the code below is fully generated by AI  \
\
fine_tuning.ipynb => preprocess data from kaggle, tokenize the words from datasets, and train the model.\
.csv files        => datasets from kaggle

current progress => can only read a sentence and return emotion based that sentence. \
next goal => fetch previous messages and predict the "true emotion" based on previous messages. 

TL;DR: Use .ipynb so I can understand each part of the code (e.g., which part handles tokenization).
