Emotion detecting Artificial Intelligence using IndoBERT

!DISCLAIMER! \
this code is fully generated by AI as of right now \
\
fine_tuning.ipynb => preprocess data from kaggle, tokenize the words from datasets, and train the model.\
.csv files        => datasets from kaggle\


TL;DR \
why .ipynb ?\
so i can understand each parts of the code (e.g., this part of code is for "tokenization")
